# V7: Gas usage & limitations

## Control Objective

The efficiency of gas consumption should be taken into account not only in terms of optimization, but also in terms of safety to avoid possible exhaustion. Smart contracts by nature have different limitations that, if they are not taken into account, can cause different vulnerabilities.

Ensure that a verified contract satisfies the following high-level requirements:
* The use of gas is optimized and unnecessary losses are prevented,
* The implementation is in line with the smart contracts' limitations.

| **7.7** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that, if signed transactions are used for relaying, the signatures are created in the same way for every possible flow to prevent replay attacks. |
| **7.8** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that there exists a mechanism that protects the contract from a replay attack in case of a hard-fork. |

# V8: Business logic

## Control Objective

To build secure smart contracts, we need to consider security of their business logic. Some of the smart contracts are influenced by vulnerabilities by their design.
The components used should not be considered safe without verification. Business assumptions should meet with the principle of minimal trust, which is essential in building smart contracts.

Ensure that a verified contract satisfies the following high-level requirements:
* The business logic flow is sequential and in order.
* Business limits are specified and enforced.
* Cryptocurrency and token business logic flows have considered abuse cases and malicious actors.

| **8.6** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the sensitive operations of contract do not depend on the block data (i.e. block hash, timestamp). |
| **8.7** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the contract uses mechanisms that mitigate transaction-ordering dependence (front-running) attacks (e.g. pre-commit scheme). |
| **8.8** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the contract does not send funds automatically but it lets users withdraw funds on their own in separate transaction instead. |
| **8.9** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the inherited contracts do not contain identical functions or the order of inheritance is carefully specified. |
| **8.10** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the business logic does not compare the extcodehash return value with 0 to check whether another address is contract (the hash of empty data is returned in such case). |

| **10.4** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the re-entracy attack has been considered when using the token contracts with callbacks (e.g. ERC-777). |
| **10.5** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the transfer business logic is consistent, especially when re-sending tokens to the same address (msg.sender == destination). |
| **10.6** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the transfer() and transferFrom() return a boolean. Several tokens do not return a boolean on these functions. As a result, their calls in the contract might fail. |
| **10.7** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the name, decimals, and symbol functions are present if used. These functions are optional in the ERC20 standard and might not be present.|
| **10.8** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that decimals returns a uint8. Several tokens incorrectly return a uint256. If this is the case, ensure the value returned is below 255. |
| **10.9** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the token mitigates the known [ERC20 race condition](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729). The ERC20 standard has a known ERC20 race condition that must be mitigated to prevent attackers from stealing tokens. |
| **10.10** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the token is not an ERC777 token and has no external function call in transfer and transferFrom. External calls in the transfer functions can lead to reentrancies. |
| **10.11** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify the [ERC conformance](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/ERC-Conformance) of ERC20, ERC223, ERC777, ERC721, ERC165, ERC1820 with ```slither-check-erc```|

# V14: Decentralized Finance

## Control Objective

The Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a concept with various financial applications deployed on blockchain using smart contracts. This category covers the security requirements for the constructions used by the DeFi applications such as lending pools, flash loans, governance, on-chain oracles, etc.

Ensure that a verified contract satisfies the following high-level requirements:
* The assets controlled by decentralized finance are safe and cannot be withdrawed by an unauthorized person,
* The data sources for decentralized finance (e.g. oracles) cannot be manipulated.

Category “V14” lists requirements related to the contructions used by the decentralized finance solutions.

## Security Verification Requirements

| # | Rating | Severity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **14.1** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the lender's contract does not assume its balance (used to confirm loan repayment) to be changed only with its own functions.
| **14.2** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the functions which change lender's balance and lend cryptocurrency are non-re-entrant if the smart contract allows to borrow the main platform's cryptocurrency (e.g. Ethereum). It blocks the attacks that update the borrower's balance during the flash loan execution. |
| **14.3** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the flash loan function can call only a predefined function on the receiver contract. If it is possible, define a trusted subset of contracts to be called. Usually, the sender (borrower) contract is the one to be called back. |
| **14.4** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the receiver's function that handles borrowed ETH or tokens can be called only by the pool and within a process initiated by the receiver's owner or other trusted source (e.g. multisig), if it includes potentially dangerous operations (e.g. sending back more ETH/tokens than borrowed). |
| **14.5** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the calculations of the share in a liquidity pool are performed with the highest possible precision (e.g. if the contribution is calculated for ETH it should be done with 18 decimals precision - for Wei, not Ether). The dividend must be multiplied by the 10 to the power of the number of decimals (e.g. dividend * 10**18 / divisor). |
| **14.6** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the rewards cannot be calculated and distributed within the same function call that deposits tokens (it should also be defined as non-re-entrant). That protects from the momentary fluctuations in shares. |
| **14.7** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the governance contracts are protected from the attacks that use flash loans. One possible security is to require the process of depositing governance tokens and proposing a change to be executed in different transactions included in different blocks. |
| **14.8** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that, when using an on-chain oracles, the smart contract is able to pause the operations based on the oracle's result (in case of oracle has been compromised). |
| **14.9** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the external contracts (even trusted) that are allowed to change the attributes of the smart contract (e.g. token price) have the following limitations implemented: a thresholds for the change (e.g. no more/less than 5%) and a limit of updates (e.g. one update per day). |
| **14.10** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the smart contract attributes that can be updated by the external contracts (even trusted) are monitored (e.g. using events) and the procedure of incident response is implemented (e.g. the response to an ongoing attack). |
| **14.11** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that the complex math operations that consist of both multiplication and division operations firstly perform the multiplications and then division. |
| **14.12** | [ ] | [ ] | Verify that, when calculating conversion price (e.g. price in ETH for selling a token), the numerator and denominator are multiplied by the reserves (see the *getInputPrice* function in *UniswapExchange* contract as an example). |
